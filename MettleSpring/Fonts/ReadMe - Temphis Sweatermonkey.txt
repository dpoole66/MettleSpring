TEMPHIS SWEATERMONKEY
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

As you might have noticed, my fontmaking efforts this week have been focused on the completion of a spiffy commercial project, the Temphis Runes. So, to celebrate the release of the Runes, here's a freeware addition to the Temphis family not found in the commercial set. Snag it now before it vanishes into the mists!

"Temphis Sweatermonkey" is an oddball sort of font, because it has a very modern look applied to letterforms meant for an (admittedly lighthearted) medieval fantasy world. It would, however, make a very nice futuristic-alien sort of thing, good for signage aboard a spaceship or other kind of project. If you enjoy this font, visit the Temphis Runes page and download the freeware sampler of that, too (which includes another free font, a patchwork frankenstein of the entire family).
