TEMPHIS KNOTWORK
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

The Temphis Runes is an ongoing hobby for me, these days; the idea is that I'll eventually have dozens and dozens of styles available for a single fantasy cypherbet.

This particular variant, Temphis Knotwork, is a rough draft of a celticky take on it, tongue in cheek. I hand-doodled the masters over giant printouts of Temphis Scrivener, modifying as I went. If you're a Uresia or Temphis Runes fan, add it to your collection ... If you're new to both, snag it and put it to whatever use you enjoy!
