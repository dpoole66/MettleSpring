TEMPHIS DIRTY
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

It’s hard for anything in Uresia to really be anachronistic (it’s a fantasy world where children have hand-held videogames), but this playful free expansion to the Temphis Runes comes close. It’s called Temphis Dirty because it’s stressed and blotted to evoke a sense of worn-out newsprint (much like one of my old standards, Dirty Headline). Like its sister fonts, Temphis Dirty is a caps-and-numerals set with limited punctuation (but that’s all the punctuation they have in Temphis, where they have more colorful fish to fry). Enjoy!
